# Homework_1_CodeRefactor
Homework for Week 1

## Introduction

The marketing agency, Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc., reached out to me as a junior developer to ensure that their website follows accessibility standards. Using the new tools and skills I recently acquried in my first few weeks of my class, I was tasked with taking an existing code and refactor it to ensure that the site is more accessible and to make the code more concise and descriptive for long term sustainability.

My motivation for doing this project was to test my skills and see if I can eventually make my own website. I got to see a few different ways to make a website, and the best way to tackle various coding issues. Starting from scratch seems like it would be a bigger challenge, so being able to refactor an existing website was a good exercise in testing my knowledge. 

### How I Refactored the Webiste

I initally tacked this challenge by adding and sorting the code by semantic HTML elements one element at a time. I first started with the header and the navigation links and worked my way down the code. Each step of the way, I would modify the code, then compare my edited website to the original unmodified website. I would then look at the CSS code and start to sort and modify the code from there. I had to ensure that each of the attributes and elements were called out correctly in the HTML and CSS files. I also sorted and edited the CSS code to ensure that the elements follow a logical and concise structure. The previous title of the website had no description of the site or the company. I added a title to the site that was more descriptive and concise than the original. Lastly, I added comments to both the HTML and CSS files to help me understand what I was editing and refactoring and to help the next person understand my thought process in the way I did my sorting and editing.

## Alt Tags

To ensure that the website followed accessibility standards, I added Alt Tags to each of the image elements. The original and primary purpose of Alt Tags is to describe images to visitors who are unable to see them. Including alt text with images ensures all users, regardless of visual ability, can appreciate the content of the site.<sup>1</sup>
