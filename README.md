# Homework_1_CodeRefactor
Homework for Week 1

## Introduction

The marketing agency, Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc., reached out to me as a junior developer to ensure that their website follows accessibility standards. Using the new tools and skills I recently acquried in the first few weeks of class, I was tasked with taking an existing code and refactoring it to ensure that the site is more accessible. I was also tasked to ensure that the code more concise and descriptive for long term sustainability.

My motivation for doing this project was to test my skills and to see if I can eventually make my own website. I got to see a few different ways to make a website, and the best way to tackle various coding issues. Starting from scratch seems like it would be a bigger challenge, so being able to refactor an existing website was a good exercise in testing my knowledge. 

### How I Refactored the Webiste

I initally tacked this challenge by adding and sorting the code by semantic HTML elements one element at a time. I first started with the header and the navigation links and worked my way down the code. Each step of the way, I would modify the code, then compare my edited website to the original unmodified website. I would then look at the CSS code and start to sort and modify the code from there. I had to ensure that each of the attributes and elements were called out correctly in the HTML and CSS files. I also sorted and edited the CSS code to ensure that the elements follow a logical and concise structure. I also found that the previous title of the website lacked any description of the site or the company. This meant if anyone wanted to find the site using a search engine, it would be nearly impossible to do so. Therefore, I added a title to the site that was more descriptive and concise than the original. Lastly, I added comments to both the HTML and CSS files to help me understand what I was editing and refactoring and to leave the code more descriptive and than I previously found it for future coders and long term sustainability.

## Alt Tags

To ensure that the website followed accessibility standards, I added Alt Tags to each of the image elements. The original and primary purpose of Alt Tags is to describe images to visitors who are unable to see them. Including alt text with images ensures all users, regardless of visual ability, can appreciate the content of the site.<sup>1</sup>
