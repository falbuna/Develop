# Homework_1_CodeRefactor
Homework for Week 1

## Introduction

The marketing agency, Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc., reached out to me as a junior developer to ensure that their website follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines.

Using the new tools and skills I recently acquried in my first few weeks of my classes, I was tasked with taking an existing code and refactor it to ensure that the site is more accessible and to make the code more concise and descriptive than the previous version.
